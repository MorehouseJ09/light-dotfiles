Quick Dotfiles
=

Initialize all of my necessary dotfiles into one quick repo.

Includes
-

-	Basic vim bash keybindings as well as cd / ls aliases
-	Basic vimrc
-	Robust tmux.conf that I use regularly
-	Basic editrc with vim bindings

Notes / Helpers
-

-	1.) If you add the vim repo as a submodule, it won't properly clone all of the repos. To pull these down properly ...

	`cd vim && git submodule update --init --recursive`
